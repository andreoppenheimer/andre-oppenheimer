title: "ENGER"
excerpt: "A program written in Python desinged to assisst in luinguistic field studies. The user can choose a word with a length between 1 to 6 syllables. The program then randomly combines linguistic features from German and English to genereate a IPA based transcription of a non-word of the desired length. The user can then apply multiple phonological rules. The results are all logged in a .txt file. One could use the produced non-word to assess through questioning L1 and L2 speakers of both languages which linguistic features hold more weight in assigning the word to one language or the other. This project was created in the context of the seminar 'Python for Linguists' by Prof. Dr. Kevin Tang at HHU University DÃ¼sseldorf. "
