title: "Streamerchat - 'Chat with your favorite streamer!'"
excerpt: "A website built with Python, HTML and CSS via Flask that uses OPENAI-API to mimic a conversation with a desired streamer. This project was created in the context of the seminar 'Informatik für Nicht-Informatiker (Programmierprojekte)' by Dr. Carl Friedrich Bolz-Tereick at HHU University Düsseldorf. Users are able to select a streamer by typing their name. Furthermore they can download the conversation and upload it to continue where they left off. - 2025 https://github.com/andreoppenheimer/streamer_chatbot"
